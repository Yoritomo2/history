                        At around 5000 BCE, agriculture centered on grains began in the Yellow River basin. 
                        In addition, recent studies indicate that a civilization centered on rice cultivation 
                        existed in the Yangtze River basin 10,000 years prior. <br><br> The development of such agrarian 
                        societies led to the establishment of cities, and the merging of these cities led to the formation 
                        of the Yin Dynasty<sup>1</sup> in the 16th century BCE. <br><br> At around the 6th century BCE, the use of iron tools and 
                        cattle farming began, further increasing agricultural productivity. Their advanced culture and technology 
                        had a notable impact on countries surrounding China, and was also introduced to Japan.

                                In the early Yayoi period, people cultivated rice fields and harvested 
                                rice using lithic tools made of hammered and polished stone and wooden
                                 farming implements. As time went on, however, metal tools became the 
                                 mainstream option for manufacturing farming implements and for harvesting,
                                  which marked the downfall of lithic tools. In addition, stilt warehouses–which 
                                  were used for storing rice–made its appearance in villages during this period.

                               Bronzeware and ironware were the two main types of metal tools of the 
                               Yayoi period. Bronze tools were used as ritual implements to pray for 
                               a bountiful harvest, while iron tools were used as weapons and farming
                                paraphernalia.

                    during the Yayoi period. <br><br> There were also changes in the types of tombs and 
                    burial methods, especially in the late Yayoi period, when large tombs embellished
                     with tomb furnishings appeared in many places. <br><br> This indicates that status differences
                      emerged within the Yayoi society and that powerful rulers appeared in various regions.

                        According to history books of the Wei Dynasty during the Three Kingdoms Period of China, 
                        there was a long period of conflict in Wakoku (Japan) in the latter half of the 2nd century, 
                        but the conflict allegedly ended after Himiko of Yamataikoku<sup>5</sup> was made queen. <br><br>
                         Later, when a union of small states centered around Yamataikoku was established, Himiko began using magical rituals 
                        in her politics. Himiko also sent envoys to the Wei Dynasty to raise the status of Yamataikoku, 
                        and she received bronze mirrors and the title of Shinigi Wao (Pro-Wei King of Wa). <br><br> After her death,
                         the country was once again in turmoil, though it was settled with the enthronement of a new queen. 
                        <br><br> However, during her reign, which was from the year 266 and lasted 150 years, references to Japan
