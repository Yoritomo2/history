                        It is believed that the first humans (or apes) appeared on the African Continent about 7 million years ago.<br><br>
                        One characteristic that was unique to apes was that they were able to walk with two legs while maintaining an upright posture. 
                        Now that their hands were free, it enabled them to manipulate tools, and as their brain capacity increased, a variety of new humans emerged. 
                        <br><br>Among these species, only the Homo sapiens, which originated in Africa about 200,000 years ago, survived<sup>1</sup>.

                        period across Japan. From this, it became clear that humans

                                Some characteristics of the Jomon culture include the creation of
                                bows and arrows to hunt boars and deer<sup>6</sup>,ground stone tools with 
                                smooth surfaces, and clay pots to cook food. Such pots had rope 
                                designs, and thus were named “Jomon pottery” (the “Jo” of Jomon 
                                refers to rope in Japanese).

                                Furthermore, peoples’ lifestyles changed—they stopped moving from one place 
                                to another and settled in pit dwellings<sup>7</sup>,  which were surrounded by shell mounds. 
                                These shell mounds are precious resources   when it comes to knowing more about 
                                life at that time. For example, from the fish hooks and harpoons that were
                                discovered, we can understand that the fishery industry was developed during
                                the Jomon period. Trade with faraway places was also prosperous. At times when
                                obsidian or jade were in demand, people even crossed oceans to acquire them.

                    It is widely accepted that people during the Jomon period believed in animism—that all plants, animals, 
                    and natural phenomena were inhabited by spirits, <br>and therefore worshiped them. The Jomon people tried to 
                    avoid natural disasters and prayed for a good harvest through sorcery.

                    <li>Meaning all humans except Homo sapiens became extinct for different reasons. 
                        For example, while Neanderthals coexisted with the Homo sapiens in Eurasia,
                         they soon proved to be inferior and were wiped out.

                    <Br>
                    <li>In the past, the “multiregional hypothesis” — the theory that hominids born 
                        in Africa spread to different regions around the world to evolve into Homo 
                        sapiens — was the mainstream theory. Nowadays, the theory that Homo sapiens 
                        spread after their evolution in Africa, called the “Out of Africa theory,” 
                        is becoming more prevalent. 
                    </li>
                    <li> In the division of geological age, he first half of the fourth period of the 
                        Cezonic era (from about 2.6 million years ago to about 20,000 years ago) is called 
                        the Pleistocene (Ice Age), and the second half (from about 20,000 years ago) is called the Holocene. 
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li> While it is generally believed that humans first came to Japan around 40,000 years ago, 
                        it is still unclear because of discoveries such as chipped stone tools in a stratum thought 
                        to be about 90,000 years old. 
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>The Neolithic period and the Jomon period refer to the same period, and only differ in terms of the basis 
                        for what is dividing the period. 
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>As the environment changed, large animals became extinct, while small and medium sized animals such 
                        as boars and deer increased. 
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Refers to the remains of shells and animal bones discarded by humans. The most popular theory is that 
                        it was originally a dumping ground, though there are also theories that say that it was a place of worship, 
                        or that it was a shell processing plant.
